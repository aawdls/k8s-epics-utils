A Diamond Light Source specific developer container.

The launcher script is specific to machines that have /dls and /dls_sw mounted so intended for running on DLS workstations only.

This is for getting DLS RHEL7 dev environment working in a container hosted on  RHEL8.

This is a stopgap so that we can use effort to promote the kubernetes model https://github.com/epics-containers instead of using effort in rebuilding our toolchain for RHEL8.
