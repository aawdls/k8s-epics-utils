A Diamond Light Source specific container for running DLS edm OPIs

Note that edm uses client side fonts. Install the font rpms on the local machine for this to work (DLS workstations should already have these)

The launcher script is specific to machines that have the dls mounts and will make all edm screens in work and prod available.
